Problems:
1. Descending Order
Function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

2. Sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result. If the input string is empty, return an empty string.

3. ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits. If valid, return true;

4. Words in a string must be compared - the one with largest score - returned. Each letter scores points depending on their position in the alphabet a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc. If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string. All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

5. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.
Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.
